# Architectural use cases üèó

---

## GraphQL server with a DB

- Greenfield projects
- Single GraphQL web server
- Resolves the queries and return the data

```notes
- Most common for greenfield projects
- Single (web) server that implements the GraphQL specification
```

---

export default Invert;

<Image src="/assets/use-case-1.png" size="1200px" />

```notes
- GraphQL also doesn‚Äôt care about the database or the format
- a SQL PostgreSQL, NoSQL like MongoDB
```

---

## GraphQL layer on existing systems

- Legacy infrastructure
- Unify and hide data fetching logic
- API gateway

```notes
- Multiple existing system behind a single GraphQL API
- Compelling companies with legacy infrastructure
- They make it practically impossible to build innovative products
- GraphQL unify and hide
```

---

export default Invert;

<Image src="/assets/use-case-2.png" size="1000px" />

```notes
- GraphQL server is responsible for fetching the data and package it up
- Doesn‚Äôt care about the reponse format
```

---

## Hybrid approach

- Connected database and integration of existing system
- Either call the db or an external API

```notes
- It is possible to combine the 2 approaches
- When a query is received it will resolve either one
```
