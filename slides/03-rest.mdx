# Comparing to REST ⚖️

---

## REST(ful)

- Standard for designing web API
- Interact with HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)
- Multiple endpoints
- Server defined structure

---

## Comparing to GraphQL

- Single endpoint over HTTP
- Idea of resource
- Shape of the resource isn't coupled how you retrieve it
- Traverse from the entry point (`Schema`) to related data

---

## Pain points of REST

---

### Overfetching

**Downloading superfluous data**

✅ _GraphQL - Clients can minimize the amount of data_

---

### Underfetching

**The n+1 request problem**

✅ _GraphQL - Graph traversable data structures_

---

### Fast Product Iterations on the Frontend

**Variety of different frameworks and platforms**

✅ _GraphQL - Each client can access precisely the data it needs without extra work on the server_

---

### Using the wrong HTTP verb

**Fetching data with `POST`?**

✅ _GraphQL - Getting data with `Query`, modifying with `Mutation`_
