# Comparing to REST ⚖️

---

## REST(ful)

- Standard for designing web API
- Interact with HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)
- Multiple endpoints
- Server defined structure

```notes
- Over the past decade, REST = Standard
- Great ideas, such as stateless servers and structured access to resources
- Objects in REST are addressable by URI and interact with HTTP verb
- Shape of API is linear = list of things you can access
- First question -> Which endpoint should I call?
```

---

## And GraphQL

- Single endpoint over HTTP
- Idea of resource
- Shape of the resource isn't coupled how you retrieve it
- ~~URL~~ -> `Schema`
- Traverse from the entry point to related data

```notes
- Single endpoint = full capabilities
- Idea of resource is similar
- One CORE DIFFERENCE - description of resource isn't coupled the way you retrieve it
- Following relationship defined in the schema
```

---

## Pain points of REST

```notes
- Concept of REST developed, client apps were relatively simple and dev pace wasn't nearly
- Although REST was a good fit
- The API landscape has radically changed

GraphQL was developed to cope with the need for more flexibility and efficiency! It solves many of the shortcomings and inefficiencies that developers experience when interacting with REST APIs.
```

### Overfetching

**Downloading superfluous data**

✅ _GraphQL - Clients can minimize the amount of data_

```notes
- When a client downloads more information than is actually required
- Imagine a screen when you need to show a list of users' name -> REST /users endpoint
- Increased mobile usage, low-powered devices and sloppy networks (one of the reasons fb developed)
```

---

### Underfetching

**The n+1 request problem**

✅ _GraphQL - Graph traversable data structures_

```notes
- A specific endpoint doesn’t provide enough of the required information
- Make additional requests
- Github repository and owner's name
```

---

### Fast Product Iterations on the Frontend

**Variety of different frameworks and platforms**

✅ _GraphQL - Each client can access precisely the data it needs without extra work on the server_

```notes
- Doesn't allow rapid iterations -> every change that is made to the UI, there is a high risk that now there is more (or less) data required
- Kills productivity
- Continuous deployment has become a standard, rapid iterations and frequent product updates
- Support more than 1 client frameworks/platforms
```

---

### Using the wrong HTTP verb

**Fetching data with `POST`?**

✅ _GraphQL - Getting data with `Query`, modifying with `Mutation`_

```notes
- Ending up building ad-hoc REST endpoints which violates one of REST's major goals
- Complex operations that touch multiple parts of an application’s data model are difficult to model as a PUT, DELETE, POST, or PATCH on a single resource
```
