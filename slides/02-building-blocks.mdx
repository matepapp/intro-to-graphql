## Query

- Single endpoint
- Structure of the data is flexible
- Client declares its data needs

```notes
- REST -> data loaded from specific endpoints
- Each endpoint clearly defined structure
- Client needs to send more information to the server to express its data needs -> Query
- Response is a JSON which keys are query-defined and the values are what the server returns
```

```graphql Query Github user
query {
  viewer {
    name
    email
    company
    location
  }
}
----

2, 7

```notes
- Basic query
- You don't have to start with query keyword, that's the defaul operation
- Fields
```

```notes
- If the operation succeeded then data, else data empty and array of errors
- If I just delete `location`, then ...

## Mutation

- `Query` with side effect
- Any operations that cause writes
- **C** _(R)_ **U** **D**

```notes
- Focus on data fetching, but any complete data platform needs a way to modify server-side data
- Mutation field returns an object type, you can ask for nested fields
- Fetching the new state of an object after an update
```

---

```graphql Starring a Repository
mutation AddStar {
  addStar(input: { starrableId: "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM1NDA5MTk=" }) {
    starrable {
      id
      stargazers(last: 1) {
        nodes {
          login
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
*
1, 7 > 'mutation' keyword is required
2 > Define which repository with its starrable ID
3:10 > Use response to update UI
```

```notes
- Mutations follow the same syntactical structure as queries, but they always need to start with the
- Updating a card's name, then fetching the card's data
```

  "data": {
    "addStar": {

              "login": "matepapp"

## Subscription

- Realtime connection to the server
- Stream of data
- Wrapper around websockets

```notes
- Get immediately informed about important events
- Initiate and hold a steady connection to the server
- Server pushes the corresponding data to the client
- Unlike queries and mutations that follow a typical ‚Äúrequest-response-cycle‚Äù
- Subscriptions are written using the same syntax as queries and mutations
```

---

## Schema and Schema Definition Language _(SDL)_

- GraphQL's own strongly typed language
- Schema specifies the capabilities of the API
- A contract between the server and client
- Special root types `Query`, `Mutation`, `Subscription`

```notes
- Basic understanding Query, Mutation, Subscriptions pull it together
- One of the most important concepts
- All the capabilities of the API and define how the clients can get data
- Language agnostic -> GQL Schema language
- Collection of types but special root types, entry point of every gql server
- Endpoints in a REST API is similar to the list of fields on the Query and Mutation types
- Pimped up Swagger
```

```notes
- Strong type system to define the capabilities of an API
- All the types that are are written down in a schema using the (SDL)
- Schema serves as the contract between the client and the server
- Imagine there's a meeting with FE and BE to talk about the API -> result Schema
- Can do their work without further communication since they both are aware of the structure
- FE teams can mock the API and then when the server is done, use the real impl.
```

## SDL Types

- Object
- Scalars
- Enumeration
- Interface
- Union types

```notes
- Most basic components Objects
- Has name, fields represent concrete data -> Scalar types comes in
- Int: A signed 32‚Äêbit integer
- Float: A signed double-precision floating-point value
- String: A UTF‚Äê8 character sequence
- Boolean: true or false
- ID: unique identifier. The ID type is serialized in the same way as a String
- Enums: particular set of allowed values
```

---

```graphql Root types
type Schema {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
}

type Query {
  viewer: User!
  repository(owner: String!, name: String!): Repository
  organization(login: String!): Organization
  ...
}

type Mutation {
  addStar(input: AddStarInput!): AddStarPayload!
  ...
}
