# Pros ✅ and Cons ⛔️

---

### ✅ Strongly typed schema

```notes
- A GraphQL schema is the backbone of every GraphQL API
- Clearly defines the operations
- Developers don’t have to manually write API documentation any more it can be auto-generated
```

---

### ✅ No more overfetching and underfetching

```notes
- Clients can retrieve exactly the data they need
- Doesn't have to rely on REST endpoints predefined data structure
- Solves over- and underfetching
```

---

### ✅ Rapid product development

```notes
- Makes frontend developers life easy
- Powerful client libraries
```

---

### ✅ Rich open-source ecosystem and community

```notes
- The community and open source ecosystem behind GraphQL is amazing.
- New tools and solutions
```

---

### ⛔️ Caching

```notes
- Caching is hard, either on server on client side
- You cannot cache the data by an endpoint since the response format is dynamic
- Apollo has an advanced caching solution
- Can be matured
```

---

### ⛔️ A fairly new technology

```notes
- 4-7 years old technology
- Learning material, common patterns, courses compared to REST
```

---

### ⛔️ Not so widespread in mobile dev

```notes
- How does it fit into mobile from architecture standpoint?
- MVC, MVVM, Flux? Network, domain, view model layer?
- No industry standard solution
```

## Is GraphQL the future?

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/2Y8Iq3xe121Ba3hUAM/giphy.gif)

```notes
- I can't say that GraphQL is the future, but I hope it looks a lot like GraphQL
- It has some unanswered questions
- Open source under Facebook, it controls the development. Slow down, but good
- Another fancy way to call the server for data but IMO it's a huge leap comparing to REST
- Wouldn't start a simple, greenfield project with REST

# Apps are just pretty pictures of JSON

```notes

- With GraphQL you can easily map your whole app/website data into UI
```
