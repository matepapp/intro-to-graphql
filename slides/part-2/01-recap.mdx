## Main concepts

- Declarative data fetching
- Schema Definition Language (SDL) with its type system
- Interacting with `Query`, `Mutation`, `Subscription`

---

## Query

- Single endpoint
- Structure of the data is flexible
- Client declares its data needs

---

## Mutation

- `Query` with side effect
- Any operations that cause writes
- **C** _(R)_ **U** **D**

### ✅ Strongly typed schema

### ✅ No more overfetching and underfetching

### ✅ Rapid product development

### ⛔️ Caching

### ⛔️ A fairly new technology, not so widespread in mobile dev
