## Working with GraphQL

- Code generation
- Developer experience
- Code sharing between platforms

```notes
- Delightful experience on the client side
- Since we have a strongly typed schema which makes possible to generate code (types, interfaces)
- Amazing developer experience with tools (GQL Playground), IDE integrations, build time network communication
- Queries and Mutations are language agnostic
```
