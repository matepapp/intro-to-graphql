# Intro to GraphQL

An introductory presentation about GraphQL.

For demonstration purposes I created a very simple database and GraphQL API wrapper using [Prisma](https://prisma.io). You can try it out [here](https://eu1.prisma.sh/mate-papp-6c597a/intro-to-graphql/demo) in [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) or you can browse the source in the `prisma` folder.

Shoutout to @pomber for creating [code-surfer](https://github.com/pomber/code-surfer).
